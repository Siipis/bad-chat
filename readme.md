# Bad Chat
*Public arcive
Operational 2016-2019*

Bad Chat was home to a vibrant small online community for three years before the popularity of Discord. The chat functioned on an invite only policy, where each user had the ability to vouch for their friends. The vouching system allowed the chat to run with a mostly hands off approach moderation wise, as users with no vouches were unable to enter the room unless vouched by someone else.

## Some notable features
Revokable invitation system (vouches) coupled with moderation tools. Users were able to create their own channels and moderate them freely. The chat took inspiration from the old IRC slash commands to provide a broad list of available actions, as well as more modern utilities such as emojis and individual colors for each chatter.

## The stack
The chat was built on top of the Laravel 5.2 using the Twig templating engine on the backend and AngularJS in the front-end.
