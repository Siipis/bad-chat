<h1>Shadow Chat has closed</h1>

<p>For years, even before I came along, RF's offshoot chatroom was a vibrant community where friends came together to hang out. Those days there weren't many social media platforms that supported chatrooms, but times have changed same as the community itself has changed. Many of us are busier than before, meaning it's become increasingly harder for people to come together, to sit together for an hour or two. We've seen many friends marry, get jobs, start families -- the needs of the people aren't the same as before.</p>

<p>The internet has changed too, not always in good ways. Public discourse has become increasingly polarized, and it's been impossible to keep that out from a place that used to be a safe environment for all. There's no stopping those cultural forces, I've learned. There's only hope that one day we'll all be able to come together and listen, to learn, and to understand. But for now, it's time to move on.</p>

<p>So it's time to bid farwell to Shadow Chat. The Discord server will stay, as Discord allows for more asynchronous conversations than what Chat has been able to provide, and without the high server costs that have been required to keep Shadow Chat running. I thank those who've helped keep the place up, with all my heart. Without you, we couldn't have gone on for as long as we did.</p>

<p>PS. For those not yet on Discord, feel free to email me at ami<span class="bot-trap">bot-trap</span>@varjohovi.net for the invite link.  I hope to see you there!</p>
